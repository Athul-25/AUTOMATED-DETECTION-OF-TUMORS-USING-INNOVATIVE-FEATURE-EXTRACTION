To develop an automated system for brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To classify MRI images into two categories: "Tumor" and "Non-Tumor." 
To reduce the time and effort required for manual diagnosis by radiologists. The  tumor detection system leverages the power of CNNs to provide accurate, efficient, and
real-time diagnosis from MRI images. With advanced preprocessing techniques, a user-friendly interface, and robust model training, this solution streamlines the diagnostic
process, supporting timely and reliable medical decisions.
